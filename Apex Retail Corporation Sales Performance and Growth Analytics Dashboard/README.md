## Project Background

As a Business Analytics Consultant at Apex Retail Corporation, the objective was to deliver an insightful Sales Performance Dashboard spanning 2020 to 2023. The analysis focused on transactional sales data enriched with customer and geographic information to provide a comprehensive view of performance across key financial and operational metrics. With over four years of detailed transactional and product-level data, the goal was to equip management with actionable intelligence on sales volume, profitability, regional trends, and product category dynamics to drive strategic decisions.

## Executive Summary

Across the 2020-2023 period, total sales grew substantially from $484K in 2020 to $733K in 2023, reflecting a compounded increase of over 50%. Profit also showed a healthy upward trend, rising from $50K to $93K, underscoring improved margin management and sales effectiveness. Total quantity sold doubled from 8,000 units in 2020 to 12,000 units in 2023, signaling robust market demand. Regionally, the Western market consistently led with sales exceeding $700K cumulatively, while the East, Central, and South regions contributed variably but with positive growth trajectories. Product category analysis confirms Furnishings, Office Supplies, and Technology as core revenue pillars, with sustained demand in subcategories like Chairs, Bookcases, and Accessories.
