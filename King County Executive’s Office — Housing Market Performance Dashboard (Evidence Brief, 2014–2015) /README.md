## Project background

Engaged by the King County Executive’s Office as an external data consultant, the goal was to design an evidence driven housing dashboard that translates parcel‑level 
sales into actionable insights for transparency, planning, and policy.  The analytical dataset comprises 21,060 closed sales dated 2014‑05‑02 through 2015‑05‑27 with 
attributes spanning structure size, quality, amenities, and location (ZIP, latitude/longitude).  The deliverable emphasizes an executive‑summary narrative, clear KPIs, 
and targeted recommendations consistent with a concise evidence brief. 

## Executive summary
Median sale price is $445K with an average of roughly $500K, and the inter‑decile band spans about $245K to $830K, indicating a broad mid‑market with a long high‑end tail.   
Homes with waterfront access command a median near $780K versus roughly $445K for non‑waterfront, a premium of about 75% that reflects scarcity.  
Space is the primary value driver, with average price‑per‑square‑foot near $258 and a price–living‑area correlation around 0.656.
Premium ZIPs cluster on the Eastside and select Seattle neighborhoods—98039 ($1.20M), 98040 ($925K), 98004 ($915K), 98112 ($795K), and 98005 ($758K).

## Insights deep‑dive

### Price levels and distribution
- Median price is $445K and mean is near $500K, with an inter‑decile range from roughly $245K to $830K. 
- June 2014 daily averages track in the low‑$500Ks, for example about $491K–$533K across the first three days. 

### Geography and premium ZIPs
- Highest medians occur in 98039 ($1.20M), 98040 ($925K), and 98004 ($915K), reflecting amenity proximity and supply constraints.
- Targeting and inventory strategies in these ZIPs should emphasize high‑spec product aligned with structurally higher willingness to pay. 

### Property characteristics
- Bedrooms distribution is anchored in family segments: 3‑bed (9,728), 4‑bed (6,626), and 2‑bed (2,754) dominate.
- Bathrooms skew toward 2.5 (5,321), 1.0 (3,852), and about 1.8 (3,041), consistent with typical single‑family layouts. 
- Average price‑per‑square‑foot of roughly $258 and a price–living‑area correlation near 0.656 underscore size as a core lever. 

### Amenities, quality, and condition
- Waterfront median is roughly $780K versus about $445K for non‑waterfront, indicating a persistent amenity premium. 
- Excellent view paired with Very Good condition approaches a $1.0M median, compared with about $480K for No View at Very Good condition. 
- Even at Average condition, Good or Excellent views lift medians well above No View peers. 

### Vintage and quality tier
- Medians rise with newer vintages: 2010s around $530K and pre‑1940 around $518K lead, followed by 1980s‑90s near $460K and 2000s near $482K. 
- Where view or waterfront is absent, grade and condition upgrades can close amenity gaps and improve valuations. 

## Recommendations for County leadership
- Targeted affordability strategy: prioritize program support and permitting acceleration in non amenity ZIPs where medians trail county leaders to expand attainable supply.  
- Amenity aligned pricing and taxation analysis: quantify recurring waterfront and view to inform valuation models and communications on assessment equity.
- Rehabilitation and modernization: emphasize additions that increase livable square footage and elevate grade/condition given the strong size price linkage. 
- Public transparency: publish a resident‑facing dashboard with explanatory text, methods, and quarterly refresh to support trust and policy dialogue. 

## Key questions for decision‑makers
- Which objectives—affordability, revenue stability, neighborhood vitality—should anchor the KPI set and review cadence. 
- What thresholds should define ZIP‑level program targeting to align interventions with measurable outcomes.
